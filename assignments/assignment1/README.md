# Requirements

- Implements a Python LRU Cache via [Decorator](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_decorators.php) called @lru_cache
- Limit the number of requests an entity can send to an API within a time window e.g., 15 requests per second.
- The rate limiting should work for a distributed setup, as the APIs are accessible through a cluster of servers.
